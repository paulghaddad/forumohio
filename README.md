Forum Ohio
=============

## Purpose

This site is built for Ohio Forum, a psychology practice in Columbus, Ohio. Please visit the site at:

http://www.forumohio.com/

## How it was built

The site is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript starting from my personal framework: 

https://github.com/paulh16/pgh_framework

Other tools used to build the site are:

* Bower
* Respond.js for media queries in Internet Explorer 8
* SASS
* Grunt
* Modernizr
* Adobe Typekit Fonts

The site is responsive, starting from a mobile layout. The layout adjusts several times as the screen widens until it reaches the desktop version. The site is hosted on a MediaTemple dedicated server using the CentOS Linux distribution.
